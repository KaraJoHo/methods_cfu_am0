# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel pretty good about it. I will definitely play around with them for practice.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Not very confident. I struggled with these, but I'm slowly starting to understand it.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I had a very difficult time understand the difference between implicit and explicit return values
When explicitly returning something, it doesn't output anything. What is the return value's importance? Is it carried on throughout the rest of the program?
I struggled with defining the last example in final practice, to output the string greeting
I think I finally figured it out, but most of the examples for making your own method had
integers, the only strings were in puts statements. So I was confused on making a method that
takes in strings.
